                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>The <strong>Child and Youth Mental Health (CYMH) Committee</strong> of Imagine Citizens Network (ICN) is dedicated to improving care for children and youth by amplifying their voices and lived experiences.</p>
            </section>

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <div class="key-stat">
                    <p><strong>70%</strong> of mental health problems begin early in life<sup>1,2</sup></p>

                <h2>The Impact</h2>
                <p>Acute hospital care is often the first form of mental health support that children and youth receive and accounts for the largest proportion of health care expenses.<sup>6</sup> However, the greatest cost is not financial—it is the emotional toll on children, youth, and their families, who often feel isolated, frustrated, misunderstood, and mistrustful of the healthcare system.</p>
                
                <blockquote class="vision-quote">
                    What if healthcare providers and organizations could learn to offer better care by listening to the lived experiences of real people?

            </section>

            <section class="approach-section">
                <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                <p>Patients offer crucial insights on care quality, particularly regarding access, coordination, and respect for their cultural and personal needs.<sup>7</sup> This patient perspective forms the foundation of patient-centred healthcare. Because patients are present for every step of their care journey, they have a unique and comprehensive view of the quality of care they receive.<sup>8</sup></p>
                
                <p>Research confirms that patients' perspectives on care quality complement traditional clinical and administrative measures.<sup>8,9,10</sup> Healthcare quality is defined by both technical medical procedures and the way care is delivered.<sup>8,11</sup> While many definitions of healthcare quality exist, most emphasize patient experience as a key component.<sup>12</sup></p>
                
                <p>The lessons learned from the personal, youth-centred stories we collect can benefit not only healthcare but also relationships, workplaces, and communities. By learning from these experiences, current and future health providers can better understand how to improve care for children, youth, and their families.</p>
                
                <p>Through these stories, healthcare professionals will gain firsthand insights, which will inspire them to engage in thoughtful conversations and collaborate more effectively with those navigating youth mental health challenges.</p>
                
                <p>By listening to, reflecting on, and learning from these lived experiences, we aim to foster greater knowledge, empathy, and understanding among healthcare providers, empowering them to better support children and youth in Alberta's healthcare system.</p>

                    <p>We acknowledge that Alberta is the traditional and ancestral meeting grounds for many Indigenous People, presently subject to Treaty 6, 7, and 8 territorial lands. These lands are the traditional territories of the Blackfoot Confederacy, the Cree, Dene, Saulteaux, Nakota Sioux, Stoney Nakoda, the Tsuut'ina Nation as well as the Métis Nation of Alberta and part of the traditional Homeland of the Métis Nation.
